<table><tr><td bgcolor=Black><font color=White>" The world requires some novel concepts to investigate future transportation"</font></td></tr></table>

Alfa-Romeo Regalo is a conceptual design facing on the requirement of ferrying between different space stations. The shipment of spacemen and -women, cargos, foods, documents... can all be achieved through this space sraft.

And it's super minimized! Comparing to any kind of spaceships currently exist.

You can take a brief view on [TJU Industial Design Galary](http://idesign.tju.edu.cn/exhibitions/index/work_detail/id/195/type/biye.html) to maintain a direct insight to the design and the intelligent designer, Lorraine Jade.
